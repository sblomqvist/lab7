# About Me

I am a senior biology major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst most interested in evolution and infectious disease. I am in my third year of doing research in Dr. Riley's lab, where I lead a project inferring the evolutionary relationships between antimicrobial bacteriocin proteins from their phylogenies. After graduation I intend to continue my career in academic research, gaining skills and contributing to scientific understanding.
