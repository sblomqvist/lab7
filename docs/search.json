I am in my third year of research in Dr. Riley’s lab, where I lead a project inferring the evolutionary relationships between antimicrobial bacteriocin proteins from their phylogenies. After graduation I intend to continue my career in academic research, gaining skills and contributing to scientific understanding, hopefully in evolution or infectious disease.\n\n\nPicture\n\n\n\nPicture of Me"
